## Information

This is a project 1 (Landing Page) for Udacity Web Development Professional Nanodegree Program.
The project requirements:

1. Dynamically building the navigation based on the content of the page.
2. The section actively being viewed will be differentiated with background and shadow.
3. When user click on item in the navigation bar the browser will scroll to its section smoothly.

In addition to these requirements, I added some features:

1. The navigation bar will be hidden automaticlly after 3 seconds with no scrolling.
2. Always show the navigation on the top of the page.
3. Back-to-top button, will be hidden at the top of the page.
4. Transition on the navigation bar and the back-to-top button when showing and hiding.
5. Make all sections collapsible.

I also changed the colors and the content of the page.
